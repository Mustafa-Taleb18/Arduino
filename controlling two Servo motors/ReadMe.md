#### **The objective**:
Desgining a system to control two Servo motors independently.

#### **Requarements**:

* Aduino Uno
* buttons (2)
* variable resistors (2)
* Servo motor (2)

#### **The explenation**:

The Servo motor compine of DC motor with multiple gears (to increase the torque and a capability to carry more weights) and connected to a potentiometer. The main advantage of Servo motor is the ability to detect the degree of rotation (Closed loop system), On the contrary of Stepper motor (Open loop system).
