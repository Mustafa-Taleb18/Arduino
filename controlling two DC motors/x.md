# Objective:
Desgining a system to control the speed and the direction of two high current DC motor indepantly
Requarement:
Aduino Uno
buttons (4)
L298 motor driver 
DC motor (2)
The explenation:
The most simple and famous of electric motors is the DC motor. 
It can rotate by clockwise directin or the oppiste direction
it work by high torqe and low speed.
usually uses in toys and moving vehicles like Wheeled Mobile Robots (WMR)
We use two motors to simulte the control of Wheeled Mobile Robots, each motor is control the wheel of one side
the speed contrllong is implement by software, but ofcourse we can use a variable resistors to control the speed
There are two functions of L298 motor driver, the first is to oprate the motor in two direction and the seconde is to oprate the motors theat consumed more current than Arduino output
