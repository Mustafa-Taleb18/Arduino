#### **The objective**:
Desgining a system to control the DC motor using two relies

#### **Requarements**:

* Aduino Uno
* buttons (2)
* rely (2) 
* DC motor 
* external power supply  (2)

#### **The explenation**:

The L298N driver can work with motors up to 2A, but what if the input current of motor is more than 2 A? we using rely. The relay isolation the control circuit from the load circuit **completely**
