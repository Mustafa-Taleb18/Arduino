#### **The objective**:
Desgining a system to control direction and speed of Stepper motor unipolar (Half cycle) without library (to understand how it's work).

#### **Requarements**:

* Aduino Uno
* buttons (2)
* ULN 2003 
* Stepper motor 
* variable resistor

#### **The explenation**:

It's type of DC motor, that control the accurate of the position , but without feedback (open loop system).

The ULN 2003 is relay driver IC, that used to isolate the control circuit from the load circuit such as relays,lamps and LEDs, which may have a high âˆ’ voltage or high current current darlington driver. The output current is 500 mA  (600 mA peak).
