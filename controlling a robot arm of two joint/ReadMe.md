#### **The objective**:
Desgining a system to control the 2 DoF robot arm, with the Forward Kinematics and Inverse Kinematics
#### **Requarements**:

* Aduino Uno
* LCD 
* Servo motors (2) 
* Keypad 
* Breadboard

#### **The explenation**:

There are two many methods to control the positoin of arm, the first is **Forward Kinematics**, in this method, the angle of each joint are known and the positoin of any point is unknown. The seconde method is **Inverse Kinematics** which the position of some point on the robot are known, but The angles of each joint needed to obtain.

The functions of Keypad are:
 * Choosing the forward or inverse Kinematics.
 * Entering the the positoin of joint that we need to obtain it.
 * Entering the values of angles.
